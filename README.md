PPPC (PHP Piped Process Communications)

Need to spawn a new independent PHP process and pass arguments to it? Command line is too risky.

<br>```exec("nohup php program.php arg1 arg2 &")``` (Too Risky!!)

Try using the above code files as boiler plate to spawn a new independent process and pass data.
