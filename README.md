PPPC (PHP Piped Process Communications)

Need to spawn a new independent PHP process and pass arguments to it? Command line is too risky.
<br>
<h5>Say no to :</h5> ```exec("nohup php program.php arg1 arg2 &")```
<br>
Try using the above code files as boiler plate to spawn a new independent process and pass data.
